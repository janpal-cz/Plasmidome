# Plasmidome of chicken gut
This GitHub repository accompanies a manuscript currently under review. 

It provides Python scripts for plasmidome-associated analyses, including normalization of resistance, plasmid and MGE content abundance, and visualization of the data using Matplotlib. 
Data tables and images generated by these scripts are included in this repository, see `Results/`.
